    Life on earth became impossible
    due to several catastrophic events. You are one of the last researchers from
    earth that got chosen to find a new planet that is suitable for human life.



    You
    will collect minerals from different planets that help to decide if a planet
    is suitable for human life or not. The computer identified two planets. Pick
    one of them. '
