Dynamic and non deterministic gameplay: 

- The enemies (monsters) follow the player along the x - axis when the player comes to close. If the player
  touches the monster he loses one lifepoint. When the monster detects the player it increases its speed
  to make it harder to escape. 
  I tried everything to also let the monsters follow the player along the y-axis but it never worked how it should. 
  The monsters were either hoovering or moving through ground.

Element of randomness: 

- For each play session the collectibles (minerals) spawn at a different location in the game. 

- ItemSpawner.cs Script in: Assets/Scripts


Element to increase difficulty: 

- A level has a time limit of 60 seconds now. When the time is over the Game Over panel opens and the level has to be 
  restarted.
